# Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) with the LINCS L1000 Data

In this notebook tutorial, we're going to showcase a Machine Learning application using the L1000 signatures as features. In particular, we're going to predict the adverse drug reactions with the data. 

# 0. 
I'll first give a breif introduction about the ML framework that'll be used in this study. 
MLC is a 

# 1. Prepare datasets for the machine learning task

Next, we're going to prepare the L1000 signatures and other relevant data for the MLC task predict drug side effects.
